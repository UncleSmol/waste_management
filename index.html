			<h1>The Waste Management Hierarchy</h1>
			<div class="content-holder">
				<div class="text-holder">
					<p>
						The waste management hierarchy is a set of steps designed to
						minimize waste and its environmental impact. It prioritizes reducing
						waste production, reusing materials, recycling, and finally, safe
						disposal. Here's a breakdown of the hierarchy:
					</p>
					<ul>
						<li>
							<strong>Avoid:</strong> The most effective way to manage waste is
							to prevent it from being created. This involves making thoughtful
							choices about what materials to use and reducing unnecessary
							consumption.
						</li>
						<li>
							<strong>Minimize:</strong> Reduce the amount of waste generated by
							using resources efficiently and finding ways to create less waste.
						</li>
						<li>
							<strong>Separate:</strong> Ensure different types of waste are
							sorted to facilitate proper recycling or treatment. This includes
							separating recyclables from general waste.
						</li>
						<li>
							<strong>Reuse/Repair:</strong> Items that can still be used should
							not be discarded. This includes repairing broken items or
							repurposing materials whenever possible.
						</li>
						<li>
							<strong>Recycle:</strong> Process recyclable materials like glass,
							plastic, and paper into new products to reduce the need for raw
							materials.
						</li>
						<li>
							<strong>Treatment/Processing:</strong> Waste that cannot be
							recycled may undergo treatments such as composting for organic
							matter or incineration for certain types of non-recyclable waste.
						</li>
						<li>
							<strong>Dispose:</strong> As a last resort, waste that cannot be
							reused, recycled, or treated should be disposed of safely in
							landfills or other designated disposal sites.
						</li>

			<!-- The Waste Management Process Section -->
			<h2>The Waste Management Process</h2>
			<p>
				The waste management process involves several key steps that ensure
				waste is handled effectively and safely. Understanding these steps is
				crucial for maintaining a clean and sustainable environment in a
				hospitality setting.
			</p>

			<!-- Generation Step -->
			<h3>1. Generation</h3>
			<p>
				Waste is generated at various points in the hotel, such as:
				<br />
				â€¢ <strong>Guest Rooms:</strong> Paper, plastic, food packaging.
				<br />
				â€¢ <strong>Kitchen/Restaurant:</strong> Food scraps, cooking oils,
				packaging.
				<br />
				â€¢ <strong>Housekeeping:</strong> Used linens, cleaning chemical
				containers.
				<br />
				â€¢ <strong>Maintenance:</strong> Electronic waste, broken furniture.
			</p>

			<!-- Storage Step -->
			<h3>2. Storage</h3>
			<p>
				Waste should be stored safely and in a manner that avoids contamination
				or hazards:
				<br />
				â€¢ <strong>General Waste:</strong> Stored in designated bins to prevent
				odors and pests.
				<br />
				â€¢ <strong>Hazardous Waste:</strong> Stored separately in clearly marked
				containers.
				<br />
				â€¢ <strong>Recyclables:</strong> Sorted by material (plastic, paper,
				glass) and stored in recycling bins.
			</p>

			<div class="line-breaker"></div>
			<!-- Collection and Transport Step -->
			<h3>3. Collection and Transport</h3>
			<p>
				Waste collection should be performed regularly to prevent accumulation.
				Proper transportation ensures waste is moved to treatment or disposal
				sites without causing spillage or contamination.
				<br />
				â€¢ <strong>General Waste and Recyclables:</strong> Collected by waste
				service providers or municipal authorities.
				<br />
				â€¢ <strong>Hazardous Waste:</strong> Collected by certified hazardous
				waste handlers with appropriate safety measures.
			</p>
		</article>

		<!-- Page 14 -->
		<article class="page" id="page14">
			<!-- Treatment Step -->
			<h3>4. Treatment</h3>
			<p>
				Different types of waste undergo specific treatment processes:
				<br />
				â€¢ <strong>Recycling:</strong> Materials such as glass, metal, and
				plastic are collected and processed into new products.
				<br />
				â€¢ <strong>Composting:</strong> Organic waste (like food scraps) is
				broken down naturally to create compost.
				<br />
				â€¢ <strong>Incineration:</strong> Some waste, such as medical or
				hazardous waste, may need to be incinerated to prevent harm.
			</p>

					alt="waste plant"
				/>
			</div>
			<div class="line-breaker"></div>
			<!-- Disposal Step -->
			<h3>5. Disposal</h3>
			<p>
				Waste that cannot be reused, recycled, or treated is disposed of in
				landfills or other safe disposal sites. Safe disposal ensures the least
				harm to the environment.
			</p>
		</article>

		<!-- Page 15 -->
		<article class="page" id="page15">
			<!-- Waste Tracking Documentation -->
			<h3>6. Waste Tracking Documentation</h3>
			<p>
				Waste tracking involves documenting the types and quantities of waste
				generated and its disposal methods. This helps ensure compliance with
				legal regulations and demonstrates environmental responsibility.
